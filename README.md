# ESP8266 Rain Drop Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a rain drop sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller. The sensor measures the presence or absence of raindrops and outputs an analog voltage signal that is read by the ESP8266. The sensor value is then displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Rain Drop Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Rain Drop Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the rain drop sensor to analog pin A0 on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure proper power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections between the ESP8266 and the rain drop sensor.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Operation:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600).
   - Observe the analog values printed on the Serial Monitor. These values correspond to the intensity of rain detected by the sensor.

#### Applications
- **Weather Monitoring:** Monitor rain intensity or presence for weather-related applications.
- **Automated Systems:** Trigger actions based on rain detection, such as activating irrigation systems.
- **Environmental Sensing:** Integrate with environmental monitoring systems to track rainfall patterns.

#### Notes
- **Analog Output:** The rain drop sensor provides an analog voltage that varies based on the presence of raindrops.
- **Sensor Calibration:** Calibration may be required based on the sensitivity and environmental conditions.
- **Delay:** A delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) is added between readings to stabilize sensor outputs and prevent rapid serial communication.
